COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: JANANI G

INTERN ID: CT08NTH

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

OVERVIEW:
This project focuses on designing a Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing essential arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and follows a structured approach for efficient computation.

SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
AND (&)
OR (|)
NOT (~)
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Develop a functional ALU module using Verilog/VHDL.
Implement a testbench to validate ALU operations.
Simulate the design and analyze its performance.
DELIVERABLES
✔ ALU Implementation in Verilog/VHDL
✔ Testbench for Functional Verification
✔ Simulation Results and Performance Report

INSTRUCTIONS:
Clone this repository.
Compile the ALU module using an HDL simulator (ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, etc.).
Run the testbench to test the ALU operations.
Analyze simulation results and document performance.
